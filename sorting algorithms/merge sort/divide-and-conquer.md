The Advantage of divide and conquer algorithm is that you can decide running time easily.

 first break the problem into several sub-problems recursively and then they combine these solutions to generate a solution of the original problem.

The  divide and conquer approach involves three main steps :

*Divide : Here we Divides problem into a no. of sub-problems having  smaller instances of the same problem.
*Conquer : Then we Conquer  the sub-problems by solving them recursively.
*Combine : And in last, We Combines the solutions of the sub-problems into the solution for the original problem.

divide-and-conquer creates at least two sub-problems, a divide-and-conquer algorithm makes multiple recursive calls.

problem  (divide)-> sub-problem-1, sub-problem-2 ,....

(conquer)
sub-problem-1->solution (solve problem)
sub-problem-2->solution (solve problem)
sub-problem-3->solution (solve problem)
.
.
.
sub-problem-1-solution,sub-problem-2-solution,sub-problem-3-solution,... (combine)->  solution to problem
